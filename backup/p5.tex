Our results show that the summary features improve prediction performance in both area under the curve (AUC), $69\%$ vs $65.5\%$, and F1, $65.34\%$ vs $62.24\%$. In addition, the model that was trained on all of the features performs better than the local features model in both AUC, $83.51\%$ vs $81.08\%$, and F1, $75.45\%$ vs $74.82\%$. The first study results show that using the summary features can help predict turn transitions.

In the second study, our results show that as you shorten the summary features the prediction performance increase..
