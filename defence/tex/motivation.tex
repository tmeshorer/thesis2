\begin{frame}{Current Issues}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item For a natural conversation between human and machine, we want to conform
            to human to human turn taking system (Sacks et al, 1974)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item One speaker at the time
                    \item Overlap speech is common but brief (only 17\% of turns, 100ms long)
                    \item Gaps between turns kept to a minimum (200 ms)
                    \item No fixed turn size and no fixed conversation size.
                \end{itemize}
      \item In Human-Human conversations, conversants predict (Sacks et al, 1974) or
            signal (Duncan 1972) each other on coming turn transition
      \item Spoken Dialogue Systems mainly use time-out for predicting turn transition.      
      \item {
        However, timeouts lead to poor user interaction (Arsikere et al, 2015)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Not effective in noisy environment
            \item Too little - machine barge in during intra turn pause.
            \item Too much - user waiting for the machine.
        \end{itemize}
      }
      \item {
        Recent research tries to use utterance's local features but still do not match human performance.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Syntactic (Sacks et al 1978,De Ruiter et al. 2006)
            \item Prosodic (Ford 1996,Stolcke 2002,Ferrer 2003)
            \item Pragmatic (Ford 2001)
        \end{itemize}
      }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame} {Thesis Statement}
   \begin{enumerate}
         \item Conversant's past behavior can help predict turn transitions
         \item Past behavior is represented by summary features
         \begin{itemize}
            \item {\em Relative turn length}: current turn length so far (in seconds and words) relative to the speaker's average turn length
            \item {\em Relative Floor Control}: the speaker's control of the conversation floor (in seconds and words) relative to the total conversation length
         \end{itemize}
         \item Computed for each dialog act.
     \end{enumerate}
