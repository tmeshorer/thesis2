This thesis describe will test the hypothesis that SDS prediction of turn transition can be improved by using summary features in addition to local features. We believe that better prediction will increase the user friendliness of SDS system and lead to more efficient and fluent conversations between human and machines. To test the hypothesis, we choose pragmatics (dialog acts) to represent the user utterance. Our baseline models use current and previous dialog act to predict turn transition. We plan to compute summary features over multiple past turns of the current speaker. The features measure the \textit{relative turn length} of the current turn, and the \textit{relative floor control} of the current speaker. We than train prediction model using the summary feature as well as the local feature and test if the summary feature perform better prediction of turn transition than the baseline model.
