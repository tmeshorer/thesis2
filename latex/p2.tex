This work investigates whether summary features based on past speaker behavior in a conversation can help improve turn transition prediction.
Using the switchboard corpus, we computed for every dialog act in the conversation two summary features: \textit{relative turn length} of the current turn, and the \textit{relative floor control}.
In addition, after each dialog act in the conversation, we marked whether a turn transition occurred. Our hypothesis is that we can make better
turn transitions by using the summary features compared to using only local features.
