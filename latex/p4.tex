The rest of this thesis is as follows.  Chapter 2 presents the related work in both human-human and human-computer conversations. Chapter 3 describes the theoretical model that underlies the summary features. Chapter 4 describes the data sources, data preparation and initial data analysis. Chapter 5 describes our main study in which we compute the long term features over all the turns in each conversations. The chapter compares the baseline models as well as the model that includes the summary features. Finally, in chapter 6 we present the conclusion and future work.


This thesis is based on a paper \cite{Meshorer2016UsingPS} that was submitted and presented at Interspeech.
