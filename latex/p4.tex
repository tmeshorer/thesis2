Chapter 1 contains the introduction, the definition of the summary features and the thesis statement. Chapter 2 presents the related work in both human-human and human-computer conversations. Chapter 3 describes the first study which compute the long term features over all the turns in each conversations. Chapter 3 describe the experiment and includes the description of the corpus, the data preparation pipeline, and the result, which compares the baseline models as well as the model that includes the summary features. Chapter 4 describe the second study where we measure the long term features over shorter past time frames (5,10,20,30 past turns) and study the affect of history length on the prediction power of the long term features. Finally, in chapter 4 we present the conclusion and future work.
