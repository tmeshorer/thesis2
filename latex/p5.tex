Our results show that the summary features improve prediction performance in both area under the curve (AUC), $69.4\%$ vs $66\%$, and F1, $69.3\%$ vs $57.8\%$. In addition, the model that was trained on all of the features performs better than the local features model in both AUC, $83.7\%$ vs $81.1\%$, and F1, $77.5\%$ vs $74.8\%$. The results show that using summary features helps predict turn transitions.
