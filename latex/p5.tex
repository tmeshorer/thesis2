Our results show that the summary features improve prediction performance in both area under the curve (AUC), $0.65$ vs $0.63$, and F1, $66.42\%$ vs $54.97\%$. In addition, the model that was trained on all the features performs better than the local features model in both AUC, $0.82$ vs $0.79$, and F1, $74.87\%$ vs $74.08\%$. The results show that using the summary features can help predict turn transitions.
