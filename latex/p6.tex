This chapter presents work related to turn transition prediction in both human-human conversations and human-computer conversations. Studying human-human turn allocation mechanism might give us a clue on the inner working that humans uses during conversations when regulating turn allocation. This in turn give us a clue on how to implement such mechanisms in spoken dialogue systems.
