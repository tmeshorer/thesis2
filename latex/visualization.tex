In this section we will use visualization method in order to explore the data variables
distribution and relationships.

\subsection{Variables}

After pre processing the data, the data set contains the following variables

\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llllrr}
\toprule
Variable &  Description & Type &\\
\midrule
     Previous Dialog Act & the dialog act before the current one  & categorical\\
     Dialog Act & the current dialog act & categorical \\
     Length & length of the current dialog act in seconds & seconds \\
     Relative Turn Length (RTL)  & Relative turn length as defined in \ref{sfeatures} & percent \\
     Relative Time Control (RTC) & Relative time control as defined in \ref{sfeatures} & percent \\
     Turn Change & 1 if there was a turn change after this dialog act & binary \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Data Fields}
\end{table}


\subsection{Dialog Acts}

Figure \ref{f1} shows the relative presence of each dialog act. We can observe that the majority of dialog acts are statements, backchannels and opinions. This is true to the nature of the switchboard corpus
which consists mainly of casual conversations.

 \begin{figure}[ht!]

 \label{f1}
 \end{figure}

In figure \ref{f2} , we measure the probability that a dialog act will lead to turn change. We can observe that the majority of back channels and question will lead to a turn change.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\caption{Dialog act probability of turn change\label{overflow}}
\label{f2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Summary Features Analysis}

Since we believe that the summary features (relative turn length and relative turn control) help in
turn transition prediction, figure \ref{f3} and figure \ref{f4} show the distribution of the score for
each class of dialog act. In figure \ref{f3} that most short dialog acts (for example back channel)
or question, have short relative turn length.
In addition, we can observe that the relative turn control is around 50\% regardless of the dialog act. This represent a balance control of the dialog floor.
